                <p class="thumbnail-texts">The winter will soon give way to spring, and that can only mean one thing —
                    baseball.

                    With most teams' off-season business concluded, rosters are beginning to take shape.

                    With that in mind, everyone is starting to formulate their own opinions on the upcoming season. I am
                    no
                    different.

                    These are all only my humble opinion. I'm no secret baseball guru who has the script to the 2024
                    Major
                    League Baseball season.

                    If I say something negative about your team, don't take it to heart.

                    Without further ado, here are five bold predictions for the 2024 Major League Baseball season:
                </p>


                <span class="title-texts">
                    <h3>1. The Dodgers will win less than 100 games</h3>
                </span>
                <p>
                    It's weird to say that predicting a team to win less than 100 games is bold.

                    But that's just the kind of franchise the Los Angeles Dodgers are. They've splashed the cash
                    once again,
                    and they boast the most stacked roster in all of baseball.

                    Filled to the brim with top-tier talent across the board, the Dodgers look to be the team to
                    beat in
                    2024.

                    In terms of hitting, the boys in blue added Shohei Ohtani, Teoscar Hernandez, and Manuel Margot
                    to an
                    already loaded batting order.

                    And, on the pitching side, we all know they've been busy.

                    They've added two elite-level starters in Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Tyler Glasnow, and are
                    reportedly still
                    in on Dylan Cease.

                    In the bullpen, they've been extensively linked to Josh Hader of the San Diego Padres, who is
                    arguably
                    the best closer in baseball.

                    However, even with all this activity, I don't think the Dodgers will pass the 100-win mark.

                    While I do think the Dodgers will be great again, I don't see them quite getting to 100 — more
                    like
                    92-95.

                    The loss of Clayton Kershaw is a big one. Not only will they miss his ability on the rubber, but
                    also
                    his presence in the clubhouse.

                    Kershaw has been Mr. Dodger for so long, and it's my belief that, without the lefty, the Dodgers
                    will
                    have lost a little bit of their identity.

                    I think the starters will be good on the whole, but inconsistent. Yamamoto will be good, but
                    will have
                    starts where he gives up a lot of runs, as is to be expected with a rookie.

                    Following their starters, the Dodgers have a middle-of-the-road bullpen. They can get the job
                    done, but
                    I only fancy three arms to have standout seasons: Michael Grove, Evan Phillips, and Brusdar
                    Graterol.

                    The other arms will be serviceable, but not enough to win 100 games.

                    The Dodgers may go on to win the World Series, but I don't think they'll reach the 100-win mark
                    in the
                    regular season.

                <span class="title-texts">
                    <h3>2. The Yankees will win The AL East</h3>
                </span>

                <p>
                    There does seem to be a certain buzz around the Bronx right now doesn't there?

                    The marquee signing is obviously the fearsome Juan Soto, who signed with the New Yankees back in
                    December.

                    The young Dominican is expected to make waves in New York in his first season, with the short porch
                    in
                    right field being a massive help to the pull-heavy Soto.

                    Additionally, Alex Verdugo, whom the Yankees acquired just a week prior to Soto, will slot in the
                    other
                    corner outfield slot, alongside Aaron Judge in center.

                    Those three together form the best outfield in baseball, and they're backed up by the capable Trent
                    Grisham and Oscar Gonzalez.

                    Looking at the infield, the young Austin Wells will likely be the opening-day starter behind the
                    plate.
                    Wells really started to kick in the last few weeks of the season, and I expect him to be a top-10
                    catcher in 2024.

                    The ever-consistent D.J. Lemahieu will fill in at the hot corner, backed up by young utility man
                    Oswald
                    Peraza. Anthony Volpe, who showed glimpses of greatness in his rookie season, will be an everyday
                    shortstop for the Bronx Bombers once again, and I fully expect him to make some noise in his
                    sophomore
                    season.

                    The Yankees have been tentatively linked with Marlins second baseman Luis Arraez, but I don't see a
                    deal
                    happening. The powerful Gleyber Torres will retain his spot at second.

                    At first base, a healthy Anthony Rizzo will reclaim his starting spot. Rizzo has looked good in the
                    cage
                    during the off-season, and I envision the former Chicago Cub to pick up right where he left off.

                    The lineup looks frightening. But the pitching isn't half-bad either.

                    The indomitable Gerrit Cole will retain his spot as ace and best pitcher in baseball, followed up by
                    Carlos Rodon and Bronx newbie Marcus Stroman. Nestor Cortes, Jr. and Clarke Schmidt will round out
                    the
                    rotation.

                    Brian Cashman has also managed to keep the key pieces of the Yankees bullpen, which was the best in
                    baseball last year.

                    I fully expect that trend to continue, especially when Loaisiga and Effross return from their
                    respective
                    injuries.

                    With a full season of Aaron Judge and all these new acquisitions, I predict the boys in pinstripes
                    to
                    win the AL East and somewhere around 103 wins.
                </p>
                <span class="title-texts">
                    <h3>3. The San Diego Padres will make the playoffs</h3>
                </span>

                <p>
                    I know this sounds crazy, but I believe the severe loss of star power in San Diego could actually be
                    a
                    blessing in disguise.

                    The loss of expectation could be a huge advantage, and they've done well this offseason, given the
                    circumstances.

                    Woo-Suk Go looks like a capable replacement for the outgoing Josh Hader, and they bolstered their
                    staff
                    with
                    three quality pitchers in the deal which sent Juan Soto to the Yankees. Those pitchers were Michael
                    King,
                    Randy Vazquez, and Jhony Brito.

                    King and Vazquez will likely find themselves in the rotation, having both done well there in
                    pinstripes.
                    Brito excelled in his role as a long reliever last season for the Yankees, and one would expect he
                    slides
                    into that spot in San Diego as well.

                    Additionally, they still have a capable lineup. Tatis, Bogaerts, Machado, and Kim all stayed put.

                    There's enough firepower in that lineup to accompany a good pitching staff to at least a wild-card
                    berth.
                </p>
                <span class="title-texts">
                    <h3>4. The Boston Red Sox will win less than 80 games</h3>
                </span>

                <p>
                    The ownership in Boston is ridiculous. The fact that a ballclub with such a storied history is
                    unwilling
                    to
                    spend any real money is appalling.

                    The Boston Red Sox won't be horrific, but they'll be bad. I think they finish under .500, and I
                    could
                    see
                    this being Cora's last season at the helm.

                    The lineup is capable enough with hitters like Yoshida and Devers rounding out a solid batting
                    order.

                    The real problems come from the pitching.

                    They replaced Sale with Giolito, which is fine.

                    But they haven't done anything else. Their rotation is the same as last year.

                    The young Brayan Bello will have another good year, but Krawford, Houck, and Pivetta will all be
                    average.

                    The bullpen is atrocious as well. The only change made has been the acquisition of Greg Weissert, a
                    yo-yo
                    pitcher from the Yankees.

                    Then, of course, there's Kenley Jansen. He'll have another solid year, but there's not much he can
                    do
                    when
                    they'll be down by the ninth inning most of the time.

                    Hopefully, another year of mediocrity will kick start a change at Fenway.
                </p>
                <span class="title-texts">
                    <h3>5. Jackson Holliday will hit .300 in his first season in the majors</h3>
                </span>

                <p>
                    I'm all in on Jackson Holliday.

                    Projected to be the opening-day shortstop for the Baltimore Orioles, the 20-year-old is the far and
                    away
                    the
                    favorite for the Rookie of The Year.

                    I think he'll not only win that award, but also be in the conversation for the MVP, not too
                    different
                    from
                    the Arizona Diamondbacks' Corbin Carroll last year.

                    Holliday has all the tools to be a top-10 player in baseball one day, and I think that day will be
                    sooner
                    rather than later.

                    His disciplined approach at the plate and ridiculous hit tool project him to have an impact for a
                    contending
                    Orioles squad next season, and I think he'll hit .300.

                    Not only that, I believe he'll hit over .300 with power, popping at least 20 home runs and leading
                    all
                    rookies in doubles.

                    Scouts also project him to stick at shortstop, while Gunnar Henderson, last year's rookie of the
                    year,
                    will
                    move to the hot corner.
                </p>
